### Emergency and urgent eyecare

Over the past 12 weeks Greasby Opticians have been committed to providing urgent, emergency
and essential eyecare for our patients and will continue to do so. As restrictions are lifted, we expect the scope of our permitted testing will increase until we are in a position to recall patients for their regular reviews and check-ups.
 Until that time, we will continue to offer eyecare by appointment only, with a locked door policy in order that we can restrict the number of patients in the practice for the safety of us all. We ask that you ring 0151 605 0822 or email us at info@greasbyopticians.co.uk for advice. Please call us if you feel your vision has changed, if you have any concerns about your eye health, if you are struggling with tasks such as driving and if you have broken your glasses. Subject to a telephone consultation, we are delighted to be able to offer contact lenses for home delivery. We will continue to take advice from NHS England and our Governing Bodies regarding best practice and will update you as we know more. We look forward to seeing you all very soon. Be assured of our very best wishes.

### Practice changes

You will notice that we have reduced the number of chairs in the waiting area and kindly ask that
you attend your visit alone, wherever possible, with children accompanied by just one adult.
Magazines, leaflets and toys have been removed in line with current guidance. We have installed
protective screens at the reception desk and payment by card is preferable. Hand sanitisers will be
available for your use on entry to the practice. To ensure the safety of all our patients and staff we
will be wearing face masks and we request that you do the same. Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE) including face visors, gloves and aprons will be worn by our optometrists and dispensing staff.
All surfaces and optical equipment will continue to be sanitised regularly throughout the day. All our
staff have undergone training in â€˜Disease prevention and Infection Control and are committed to
maintaining your well-being and safety. Our dispensing staff will help you to carefully select the
spectacle frames that you wish to try on. This handling procedure will allow us to clean and sterilise
frames between patients.
