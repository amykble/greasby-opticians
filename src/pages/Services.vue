        <p>Here at Greasby Opticians we are offering many services in addition to what people would think is the standard role of the optician. All our optometrists have undertaken specialised training on a number of specific eye conditions. Our expertise in these areas supports the role of the hospital eye specialists and is funded by the NHS and Wirral PCT.</p>

              Cataracts are formed when the clear lens inside your eye becomes cloudy or misty. This is a gradual process that usually happens as we get older. It does not hurt.
              The early stages of a cataract do not necessarily affect your sight.
              The only proven treatment for a cataract is surgery. If the cataract gets to the stage where it affects your sight, your optometrist will refer you to hospital to have this done. The surgery is usually carried out under local anaesthetic and has a very high success rate.

              Glaucoma is an eye disease in which the optic nerve, which connects your eye to your brain, is damaged by abnormal pressure of the fluid inside your eye.
              This may be because the pressure is higher than normal, or because the nerve is more susceptible to damage from pressure. This may affect one or both of your eyes. If left untreated this can lead to visual field loss.
              There are two main types of glaucoma: chronic glaucoma, which happens slowly and acute glaucoma which happens quickly. Chronic glaucoma is much more common and there are no warning signs hence the need for regular eye examinations especially if there is a history of glaucoma in your family.

              Diabetes affects the eye in a number of ways. The most damaging condition occurs when the fine network of blood vessels in the retina – the light-sensitive inner lining of the back of the eye – leak fluid. This is known as diabetic retinopathy. If you are diabetic, it is very important that you have regular screening for retinopathy.
              Your local NHS will arrange this for you and it can be provided at Greasby Opticians.

              Finding a way to read comfortably is one of the most difficult challenges for visually impaired people. Many give it up altogether, because what used to be an enjoyable, effortless activity now requires thought, preparation and a lot of adjustment.
              Here at Greasby Opticians we can offer a range of low vision devices that may make reading easier and more rewarding for people with difficulties.

              The appearance of red eye ranges in severity from a few enlarged blood vessels that look like wiggly red or pink lines across the "white" of the eye (sclera) to a dense red haemorrhage that completely covers the sclera.
              Red eyes may be caused by dry eye, allergy, contact lenses issues, or common eye infections such as conjunctivitis. Redness of the eye sometimes can signal a more serious eye condition or disease, such as uveitis or glaucoma. If your red eye persists or worsens, always contact your optometrist for advice.

Floaters are normally harmless and are more common in older patients and in those who are short sighted or have had previous ocular surgery. Very occasionally, flashes of light or a sudden increase in new floaters can be a sign of retinal holes, tears or detachment, which needs treating as soon as possible. We offer Flashes & floaters service and can see you on an urgent basis should you require us.</p>
